## Single-responsibility principle

* Decomposition
* Cohesion &rarr; maximize
* Coupling &rarr; minimize

Making it black and white (this is a SRP violation vs this is not a SRP violation) is the wrong approach, too. Coupling and cohesion are scales, not booleans. That’s why we speak about “high” and “low” cohesion, “high” and “low” coupling.  

**The goal is not to be 100% decoupled and 100% cohesive, it’s doing our best to avoid unnecessary coupling and making our modules as cohesive as possible.**
